# Part I - Data Layer

With the rising popularity of superhero movies, there has been a heightened awareness of superheroes in our midst. The frequency of superhero (and supervillain) sightings is increasing at an alarming rate. Given this development, the Hero Education and Relationship Organization (HERO) has asked our company to develop a database and data layer for their new superhero sightings web application. The system has the following requirements:

- It must keep track of all superhero/supervillain information.
    - Heroes have names, descriptions, and a superpower.
    - Heroes are affiliated with one or more superhero/supervillain organizations.
- It must keep track of all location information:
    - Locations have names, descriptions, address information, and latitude/longitude coordinates.
- It must keep track of all superhero/supervillain organization information:
    - Organizations have names, descriptions, and address/contact information.
    - Organizations have members.
- A user must be able to record a superhero/supervillain sighting for a particular location and date.
- The system must be able to report all of the superheroes sighted at a particular location.
- The system must be able to report all of the locations where a particular superhero has been seen.
- The system must be able to report all sightings (hero and location) for a particular date.
- The system must be able to report all of the members of a particular organization.
- The system must be able to report all of the organizations a particular superhero/villain belongs to.
